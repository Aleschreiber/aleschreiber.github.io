Hey there! I'm Alessio Schreiber. I'm an Italian publishing consultant with background in media and vast experience in all stages of publishing. Passionate about facilitating productive cross-cultural relationships, since 2018 I've been in charge of the Foreign Rights Office at [Kalama Literary Agency](http://agenziakalama.it/). I'm also a qualified professional translator, amateur developer, dilettante musician.

I live in Rio de Janeiro.

This blog is born mostly for selfish reason. I've always been passionate about code and because I learn best by doing, I've started to keep track of software development over time. I research things I find interesting, then document my research with a public blog post, which I can easily find and refer to later. Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting.
